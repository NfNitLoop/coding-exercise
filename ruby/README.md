Ruby Coding Exercise
====================

Usually I'd capture the purpose of a codebase in its README file but I'm going 
to not copy/paste the purpose of this codebase in case someone doesn't want it
to be easily google-able. `:)`

Running
-------

1. `bundle install`
2. `ruby main.rb $someNumber`

Testing
-------

`rake test`


What I'm Pleased With
---------------------

⚠️ TODO

What I'd do with more time
--------------------------

⚠️ TODO

 * Learn more about [RBS](https://github.com/ruby/rbs)
   * Do tools support it well enough now to make it worth the effort?  
     (The last time I played w/ Python type annotations, it wasn't worthwhile.)
